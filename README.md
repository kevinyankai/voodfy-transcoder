## Prerequisites

To build from source, you need to have Go 1.14 or newer installed.

## Design

Voodfy Transcoder is a queue system used on core of Voodfy to ingest videos using Livepeeer and sendding to IPFS/Filecoin using Powergate

Here's a high-level overview of the main components, and how Powergate interacts with IPFS and a Filecoin client:

Note in the diagram that the Lotus, Filecoin, IPFS, and Powrgate client node _doesn't need_ to be in the same host where Voodfycli is running. They can, but isn't necessary.

To build and install the CLI, run:
```bash
$ make build-cli
```
The binary will be placed automatically in `$GOPATH/bin` which in general is in `$PATH`, so you can immediately run `voodfycli` in your terminal.

You can run `voodfycli` with the `--help` flag to see the available commands:

```
$ voodfycli --help
A client for transcode video and storage on Filecoin

```

## Installation

Voodfy transcoder installation involves running external dependencies, and wiring them correctly with Filecoin/Lotus IPFS and Powergate.

Please copy the `conf/app.ini` example hosted in this repository

### External dependencies
Powergate needs external dependencies in order to provide full functionality, in particular a synced Filecoin client and a IPFS node and a Redis running.

#### Filecoin client
Currently, we support the Lotus Filecoin client.

Fully syncing a Lotus node can take time, so be sure to check you're fully synced doing `./lotus sync status`.

### IPFS node
A running IPFS node is needed.

Its [Dockerhub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/ipfs/go-ipfs) if you want to run a contanerized version. Currently we're supporting v0.5.1. The API endpoint should be accessible to Powergate (port 5001, by default).

### Queue system
To build the Powergate server, run:
```bash
$ make up
```

We'll soon provide better information about the integration with Lotus/Filecoin, IPFS and Powergate configurations, stay tuned! ðŸ“»
